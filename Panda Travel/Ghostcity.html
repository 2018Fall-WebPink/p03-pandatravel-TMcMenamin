<ol><blockquote>“We had a view of the beautiful Verde Valley and were within walking distance to everything we wanted to see.” -Alanna M. </blockquote></ol>
<ol><blockquote>"Staying at the Sierra Inn felt like staying at your favorite, fun Aunt's house! It is comfortable and welcoming, while quirky in its flaws. The staff was very kind and the room was cute and cozy. I would definitely return for another (kid-free) romantic getaway with my husband!" -Kim H. </blockquote> </ol>
